    # Math Skills

    This project is a simple statistics calculator implemented in Go. It provides functionalities to calculate the average, median, variance, and standard deviation of a dataset provided through a text file named data.txt.

    ## Features

    - Average Calculation: Computes the arithmetic mean of the dataset.
    - Median Calculation: Determines the median value of the dataset.
    - Variance Calculation: Calculates the variance of the dataset.
    - Standard Deviation Calculation: Computes the standard deviation of the dataset.

    ## Usage

    1. Ensure you have Go installed on your system.
    2. Place your dataset in a file named data.txt in the same directory as the Go program.
    3. Run the program using `go run main.go`.
    4. View the calculated statistics for the dataset in the terminal.

    ## Functions

    - `Average(data []float64) float64`: Calculates the average of a given dataset.
    - `Median(data []float64) float64`: Computes the median value of a dataset.
    - `Variance(data []float64) float64`: Computes the variance of a dataset.
    - `StandardDeviation(data []float64) float64`: Calculates the standard deviation of a dataset.
